    "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
    "\n",
    "*This paper is about \"Data Tidying\" which is a small, but important, component of data cleaning. Data tidying involves formatting and cleaning source data into \"Tidy Data\", which is a a data structure that simplifies the cleaning process.*\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
    "\n",
    "*The tidy data standard is intended to make the cleaning and preparation stages of data analysis more straight and standardized. The tidy data standard makes data preparation straight forward by providing a consistent framework for dataset organization, reducing the complexity of cleaning and integrating data for analysis. The tidy data standard also enhances tool/model efficiency and also allows analysts to focus more on meaningful \"domain-specific\" problems.*\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*In the content of datasets the sentence \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" means that when a dataset is already clean it is easy to interpret and using the dataset will be uniform with any other clean dataset. When datasets are messy and unorganized they are not uniform so identifying what makes the dataset messy can be difficult.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*For the sentence:  \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\" means that within a specific dataset, identifying individual data entries and the characteristics being measured is straightforward. However, creating a definition for what exactly constitutes an observation or a variable can be challenging, as these concepts may vary widely across different datasets. This variation makes it hard to establish a universal definition that applies to all forms of data.* \n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Values are defined as data points in the data set. Values are usually numbers or strings and each value in a dataset is part of both a variable and an observation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Variables are defined as a collection of values that measure the same attribute across different units in the dataset. An example of this that Wikham provides are the variables \"Person\", \"Treatment\", and \"result\".*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Observations are defined as all the values in the dataset measured on the same unit across different attributes. An observation is usually represented as a single row in a dataset.*\n",
    "  \n",
    "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Tidy Data\" is defined as a standard way of organizing the structure of a dataset that best aligns with the purpose of the data. A dataset has to follow three principles for it to be considered tidy. Each variable has to form a column, each observation has to form a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.*\n",
    "  \n",
    "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "*The 5 most common problems with messy data sets are: column headers are values instead of variable names, multiple variables in one column, variables being stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units are being stored in a singular table, and a single observation unit being stored in multiple tables.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The data in table 4 is messy because values are column headers instead of the variables being the columns.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Melting a dataset is turning the rows of the table into columns.*\n",
    "\n",
    "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
    "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?"
